# My React Project

This project is a simple React application that covers several basic React concepts. Here are the components that have been created and the tasks they perform:

## Components

1. **SimpleElement**: This component renders a simple JSX element, such as an `<h1>` with a static message. You can see the code in `SimpleElement.tsx`.

2. **Greeting**: This component accepts a `name` prop and renders a greeting message using that prop. You can see the code in `Greeting.tsx`.

3. **App**: This component has a button. When you click the button, the component changes its state and displays a different message. You can see the code in `App.tsx`.

4. **NamesList**: This component takes a list of names as a prop and displays each name in an unordered list (`<ul>`). You can see the code in `NamesList.tsx`.

5. **Form**: This component has a form with a text input field and a submit button. When you click the button, it displays an alert with the value entered in the text field. You can see the code in `Form.tsx`.
