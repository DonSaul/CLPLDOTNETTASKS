# Homework 4 - Text File Analysis

## Overview
This C# program is designed to read a text file and perform various analyses on its contents. It reads all lines from a specified text file into an array of strings, where each array item represents one line from the file. The program then performs the following tasks:
- Counts and displays the number of symbols (characters) in every line.
- Identifies the longest and shortest lines in the file.
- Finds and displays lines that contain the word "var".

## Requirements
- .NET SDK (compatible with the version used in the project)
- A text file named `textfile.txt` placed in the project's `bin` directory

## Instructions for Running the Program
1. Clone or download the project from the repository.
2. Ensure that you have a text file named `textfile.txt` in the `bin\Debug\netX.X` directory of the project (where `netX.X` is the target .NET version).
3. Navigate to the project directory using a command prompt or terminal.
4. Execute the program using the command `dotnet run`.

## Example Output
An example of the program's output is provided in the file `example-prompt.png` located in the same directory as this README.

Note: The program's output includes a line-by-line analysis of the text file, displaying the total number of characters in each line, as well as highlighting the longest and shortest lines and lines containing the word "var".
